# polygo
polygo is a project to find errors in scratchers code (ie. minecraft-ish MMO by griffpatch)
## how to use
goto code the green button then click it you will see a button that says 
download zip. do that! you are almost done open the zip it will make a 
file. open it! then there will be something called polygo.sb3 scratch uses
these types of files for exporting and importing games. make a new project
name it whatever you want goto file in the editor then load from your computer
make sure you chose the .sb3 file. now you can use it! this is the last step
drag the sprite into your backpack goto whatever the game for that code is for 
to see look at the branch name these are what the currant version it is for
## note!
that i haven't found a way to use these scipts in cloud games
as when you go in the editor it uses diffeant cloud vers 
## i do not intend for this ("software or code") to be used in a bad maner or to preform activatys that are against scratch's Tos
